\chapter{Demographic Model}

The life course of individuals is modelled using a discrete-time, finite-state, and absorbing Markov Chain model with rewards.
The model has a matrix formulation that allows to simplify notation and ease computations. For a discussion on matrix population models see, for instance, \cite{Caswell2001} and \cite{Keyfitz2005}. For some example of early applications see \citet{Leslie1945, Leslie1948}, \cite{Keyfitz1964} and \cite{Rogers1966}.\\

This chapter is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces Markov chains, Section 2 reviews the main concepts for Markov chains with rewards, and finally Section 3 sets up the model.
The main ideas and assumptions of the mathematical model used for the analysis where taken from \cite{Caswell2006}, \cite{VanDaalen2017}, and especially \cite{Caswell2018}.
