\chapter{Demographic model}

The life course of individuals is modelled using a discrete-time, finite-state, and absorbing Markov Chain model with rewards.
The model has a matrix formulation that allows simplifying notation and easing computations. For a discussion on the general framework of matrix population models see, for instance, \cite{Caswell2001} and \cite{Keyfitz2005}. For some examples of early applications see \citet{Leslie1945, Leslie1948}, \cite{Keyfitz1964} and \cite{Rogers1966}.\\

This chapter is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces Markov chain models, Section 2 reviews the main concepts for Markov chains with rewards, and finally Section 3 sets up the model used for the empirical investigation.
The main ideas for the mathematical model were taken from \cite{Caswell2006}, \cite{VanDaalen2017}, and especially \cite{Caswell2018}.
