First and foremost, I would like to thank my thesis supervisor Prof. Francesco C. Billari.

Secondly, I am profoundly indebted to Prof. Hal Caswell for his precise methodological approach and for his guidance in the early stages of this work.\\
Lastly, I would like to thank the administrative staff of Universit√† Commerciale Luigi Bocconi for their kind support through these years.
