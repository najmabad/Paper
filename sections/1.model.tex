\chapter{Demographic Model}

The life course of individuals is modelled using a discrete-time, finite-state, and absorbing Markov Chain model. The main ideas and assumptions of the model where taken from \cite{Caswell2006, VanDaalen2017, Caswell2018}.
This chapter is structured as follows: Section 1 provides a review of the some basic concepts and terminology of matrix algebra that are instrumental to understand the mathematical framework, Section 2 introduces the idea of stochastic processes (to which discrete-time, finite-state, and absorbing Markov Chain models belong), and finally Section 3 sets up the model.
